You can try just run the

DEMO_color_image.m

For set up, we can add path by the following sentence.

addpath('Functions_LRTV');

  -- LRTV_pds.m       : main code to run tensor completion
  -- LRTV_pds_light.m : little bit light mode (skip objective calculation)
  -- unfold.m         : tensor unfolding from tensor to matrix
  -- fold.m           : tensor folding from matrix to tensor
  -- prox_nuc.m       : proximal operator with respect to nuclear norm
  -- prox_dom.m       : proximal operator with respect to box constraint
  -- prox_l12norm.m   : proximal operator with respect to l12-norm
  -- prox_indicator.m : proximal operator with respect to noise inequality constraint
